# Covid-19-Data_visualization

In this project, i got data from an online source, real covid data from 2020-2023, it was a raw data and had a lot of errors, so i had to clean it up first and make it more readable. After doing that, i wrote down questions i thought people would likely ask when they think of covid, like which country had the worst deaths recorded etc. Then i used excel to answer most of those questions by clearly visualizing the data.

In this, i added filters which makes the dashboard more responsive, you could either filter by year or continent, or both, and get answers to questions that have always been asked.
For an obvious facts, Asia as a continent has the most cases in 2023, while Africa has lesser cases. To fully interact with the dashboard, follow the link on my portfolio as that would give more insights.
